Conclusions: 
This project may have had further room for improvement by using a windowing technique to identify outliers in sets of data.
If there is a non-matching residue in a secondary structure, it must adopt the secondary structure of its neighbors. This approach
Can be conducted across columns and inserted as an additional pass to identify the true MDA of a protein (Pseudocode below). As it 
stands, a misfit in a domain will be shown in PrintMDA as a two identical domains each half the length of the true domain 
one after the other. The foundations for making this program into a web application is also provided. This would handle the 
difficulties of the extensive secondary structure prediction times, using asynchronous request handling. 


This assumes that secondary structure can be parsed as a list and the residue matrix is already annotated
